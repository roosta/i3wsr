All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v3.1.0] - 2025-01-22

### Bug Fixes

- Fix [multi-monitor window dragging issue specific to i3](https://github.com/roosta/i3wsr/issues/34)
    - Sway doesn't trigger any events on window drag

### Features

- Add sway support
- Add `--verbose` cmdline flag for easier debugging in case of issues

#### Sway

Support for [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) is added, new config key
addition `app_id` in place of `class` when running native Wayland applications:

```
[aliases.app_id]
firefox-developer-edition = "Firefox Developer"
```
`i3wsr` will still check for `name`, `instance`, and `class` for `Xwayland`
windows, where applicable. So some rules can be preserved. To migrate replace
`[aliases.class]` with `[aliases.app_id]`, keep in mind that `app_id` and
`class` aren't always interchangeable , so some additional modifications is
usually needed.

> A useful script figuring out `app_id` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/crispyricepc/f313386043395ff06570e02af2d9a8e0#file-wlprop-sh), it works like `xprop` but for Wayland.

### Deprecations

I've flagged `--icons` as deprecated, it will not exit the application but it
no longer works. I'd be surprised if anyone actually used that preset, as it
was only ever for demonstration purposes, and kept around as a holdover from
previous versions.

## [v3.0.0] - 2024-02-19

**BREAKING**: Config syntax changes, see readme for new syntax but in short
`wm_property` is no longer, and have been replaced by scoped aliases that are
checked in this order:
```toml
[aliases.name] # 1
".*mutt$" = "Mutt"

[aliases.instance] # 2
"open.spotify.com" = "Spotify"

[aliases.class] # 3
"^firefoxdeveloperedition$" = "Firefox-dev"
```

If there are no alias defined, `i3wsr` will default class, but this can be
configured with
```
--display-property=[class|instance|name]`
```
or config file:

```toml
[general]
display_property = "instance" # class, instance, name
```
