A dynamic workspace renamer for i3 and Sway that updates names to reflect their
active applications.

`i3wsr` can be configured through command-line flags or a `TOML` config file,
offering extensive customization of workspace names, icons, aliases, and
display options.

## Preview

## Rebrand and Wayland support

Now that `i3wsr` works with [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) as well as
[I3](https://i3wm.org/), the name is a bit misleading, and could do with a
change. Shame to lose the metrics, but it might help further discovery now that
it supports multiple display servers.

I've not thought of anything yet, but will advertise it here in the README
before publishing anything under a new name.

Development forward will focus on Sway, but backward compatibility with I3 will
be maintained.

## Requirements

i3wsr requires [i3](https://i3wm.org/) or [sway](https://swaywm.org/), and
[numbered
workspaces](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_named_workspaces_moving_to_workspaces),
see [Configuration](#configuration)

## Installation

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), and [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/) is
required, and `i3wsr` can be installed using cargo like so:

```sh
cargo install i3wsr
```

Or alternatively, you can build a release binary,

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Then place the built binary, located at `target/release/i3wsr`, somewhere on your `$path`.

### Arch linux

If you're running Arch you can install either [stable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3wsr/), or [latest](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3wsr-git/) from AUR thanks to reddit user [u/OniTux](https://www.reddit.com/user/OniTux).

## Usage

Just launch the program and it'll listen for events if you are running I3.
Another option is to put something like this in your i3 config

```
# cargo
exec_always --no-startup-id $HOME/.cargo/bin/i3wsr
# AUR
exec_always --no-startup-id /usr/bin/i3wsr
```

## Configuration

This program depends on numbered workspaces, since we're constantly changing the
workspace name. So your I3 or Sway configuration need to reflect this:

```
bindsym $mod+1 workspace number 1
assign [class="(?i)firefox"] number 1
```

### Keeping part of the workspace name

If you're like me and don't necessarily bind your workspaces to only numbers,
or you want to keep a part of the name constant you can do like this:

```
set $myws "1:[Q]" # my sticky part
bindsym $mod+q workspace number $myws
assign [class="(?i)firefox"] number $myws
```

This way the workspace would look something like this when it gets changed:

```
1:[Q] Emacs|Firefox
```
You can take this a bit further by using a bar that trims the workspace number and be left with only
```
[Q] Emacs|Firefox
```

## Configuration / options

Configuration for i3wsr can be done using cmd flags, or a config file. A config
file allows for more nuanced settings, and is required to configure icons and
aliases. By default i3wsr looks for the config file at
`$XDG_HOME/.config/i3wsr/config.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3wsr/config.toml`.
To specify another path, pass it to the `--config` option on invocation:
```bash
i3wsr --config ~/my_config.toml
```
Example config can be found in
[assets/example\_config.toml](https://github.com/roosta/i3wsr/blob/main/assets/example_config.toml).


### Aliases


Sometimes a class, instance or name can be overly verbose, use aliases that
match to window properties to create simpler names instead of showing the full
property


```toml
# For Sway
[aliases.app_id]

# for i3
[aliases.class]

# Exact match
"^Google-chrome-unstable$" = "Chrome-dev"

# Substring match
firefox = "Firefox"

# Escape if you want to match literal periods
"Org\\.gnome\\.Nautilus" = "Nautilus"
```
Alias keys uses regex for matching, so it's possible to get creative:

```toml
# This will match gimp regardless of version number reported in class
"Gimp-\\d\\.\\d\\d" = "Gimp"
```

Remember to quote anything but `[a-zA-Z]`, and to escape your slashes. Due to
rust string escapes if you want a literal backslash use two slashes `\\d`.

### Aliases based on property

i3wsr supports 4 window properties currently:

```toml
[aliases.name]     # 1 i3 / wayland / sway
[aliases.instance] # 2 i3 / xwayland
[aliases.class]    # 3 i3 / xwayland
[aliases.app_id]   # 3 wayland / sway only
```
These are checked in descending order, so if i3wsr finds a name alias, it'll
use that and if not, then check instance, then finally use class

#### Class

> Only for Xwayland / i3

This is the default for `i3`, and the most succinct.

#### App id

> Only for Wayland / Sway

This is the default for wayland apps, and the most and works largely like class.

#### Instance

> Only for Xwayland / i3

Use `instance` instead of `class` when assigning workspace names,
instance is usually more specific. i3wsr will try to get the instance but if it
isn't defined will fall back to class.

A use case for this option could be launching `chromium
--app="https://web.whatsapp.com"`, and then assign a different icon to whatsapp
in your config file, while chrome retains its own alias:
```toml

[icons]
"WhatsApp" = "üó©"

[aliases.class]
Google-chrome = "Chrome"

[aliases.instance]
"web\\.whatsapp\\.com" = "Whatsapp"
```

#### Name

Uses `name` instead of `instance` and `class|app_id`, this option is very
verbose and relies on regex matching of aliases to be of any use.

A use-case is running some terminal application, and as default i3wsr will only
display class regardless of whats running in the terminal.

So you could do something like this:

```toml
[aliases.name]
".*mutt$" = "Mutt"
```

### Display property

Which property to display if no aliases is found:

```toml
[general]
display_property = "instance"
```

Possible options are `class`, `app_id`, `instance`, and `name`, and will default
to `class` or `app_id` depending on display server if not present.

You can alternatively supply cmd argument:
```sh
i3wsr --display-property name
```
### Icons

You can config icons for your WM property, these are defined in your config file.

```toml
[icons]
Firefox = "üåç"

# Use quote when matching anything other than [a-zA-Z]
"Org.gnome.Nautilus" = "üìò"
```
i3wsr tries to match an icon with an alias first, if none are found it then
checks your `display_property`, and tries to match an icon with a non aliased
`display_property`, lastly it will try to match on class.

```toml
[aliases.class]
"Gimp-\\d\\.\\d\\d" = "Gimp"

[icons]
Gimp = "üìÑ"
```

A font that provides icons is of course recommended, like
[font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Make sure your bar has that font
configured.

### Separator

Normally i3wsr uses the pipe character `|` between class names in a workspace,
but a custom separator can be configured in the config file:
```toml
[general]
separator = " ÓÇ± "
```

### Default icon
To use a default icon when no other is defined use:
```toml
[icons]
default_icon = "üíÄ"
```
### Empty label

Set a label for empty workspaces.

```toml
[general]
empty_label = "üåï"
```
### No icon names
To display names only if icon is not available, you can use the
`--no-icon-names` flag, or enable it in your config file like so:
```toml
[options]
no_icon_names = true
```
### No names
If you don't want i3wsr to display names at all, you can use the
`--no-names` flag, or enable it in your config file like so:
```toml
[options]
no_names = true
```

### Remove duplicates
If you want duplicates removed from workspaces use either the flag
`--remove-duplicates`, or configure it in the `options` section of the config
file:
```toml
[options]
remove_duplicates = true
```

### Split at character

By default i3wsr will keep everything until the first `space` character is found,
then replace the remainder with titles.

If you want to define a different character that is used to split the
numbered/constant part of the workspace and the dynamic content, you can use
the option `--split-at [CHAR]`

```toml
[general]
split_at = ":"
```

Here we define colon as the split character, which results in i3wsr only
keeping the numbered part of a workspace name when renaming.

This can give a cleaner config, but I've kept the old behavior as default.

## Testing

To run tests locally [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is required. Run
`script/run_tests.sh` to run tests on ubuntu xenial.
